# millions-and-billions
I play a game called EVE online. It is a very complex game and this program was written to help deal with big numbers. In EVE online, the in-game currency uses big numbers (in the millions and billions) and typing those numbers sometimes proves to be tedious so I made this program to help with that. Instead of typing "7 000 000 000", all I need to do is type "7b" and it will automatically be copied to the clipboard to be pasted in game.
